# ⚡ Electric Vehicle Data Analysis – Tableau Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes an extensive Electric Vehicle (EV) dataset to understand the adoption of BEVs (Battery Electric Vehicles) and PHEVs (Plug‑in Hybrid Electric Vehicles). Using Tableau, I created an interactive dashboard that highlights key KPIs such as total EV count, BEV/PHEV distribution, market growth trends, and model‑year insights. The visualizations help assess EV market expansion, manufacturer patterns, and CAFV (Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle) eligibility across different regions.

## 🔑 Key KPIs
- **Total Electric Vehicles** – Overall EV landscape including BEVs & PHEVs.
- **Average Model Year** – Helps assess technological advancement and EV evolution.
- **Total BEV Count & % of Total EVs**
- **Total PHEV Count & % of Total EVs**
- **BEV vs PHEV Share** – Percentage comparison to understand market dominance.

## 🛠 Understanding BEV vs PHEV
| BEV (Battery Electric Vehicle) | PHEV (Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle) |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Runs **only on battery** | Runs on **gas or battery** |
| No combustion engine | Combination of ICE + Battery |

## 🧪 CAFV Explanation
- **CAFV Eligible:** Meets government clean‑fuel incentive standards.  
- **CAFV Not Eligible:** Does not meet alternative‑fuel criteria.  
- **CAFV Unknown:** Still under evaluation or insufficient data.
